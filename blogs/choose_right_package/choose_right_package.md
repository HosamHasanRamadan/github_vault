# Pub.dev How to choose the right package
 
If you're struggling to choose the right package from Pub.dev's vast library of over 35K packages, this article will guide you through the process.

It's important to remember that once you've added a package to your project, it's your responsibility to keep up with updates and news related to that package. So, choosing the right package is crucial.

Here are the steps to follow:

### 1.  Define Your Problem  
Start by defining your problem accurately and specifying your expectations for the package. Be clear about how you want the package to solve your problem.
    
### 2. Check Flutter and Dart API Before You Browse Pub.dev  
 Before diving into Pub.dev, check the Flutter and Dart API. You may find that the solution you need is already available in the SDK.
    
### 3. Consider the Platforms You're Supporting  
Make sure to read the package documentation carefully, as some features may not work on all platforms, even if the package can be compiled on all platforms.
    
### 4. Packages Metrics :  

- **Documentation and Testing**
	Read the package documentation and check its quality and clarity. Look for examples and check the testing coverage and quality of the tests.
	 
- **Code Quality**
	Take a tour inside the code and check the style and quality of the code. Evaluate the complexity and readability of the code and consider how you can contribute to it.
	
- **Package History** 
	Check the update history and change logs to see how the package has evolved over time. This can give you an idea of how active the package is and whether it's being actively maintained.

- **Transitive dependency**
	Check the transitive dependencies and evaluate how heavy they are in maintenance. This can help you avoid packages with unnecessary dependencies that may add to the complexity of your project.
	
- **Community Activity**
	Check the issues section in GitHub and see how issues are being handled. Also, check the PRs and their acceptance criteria. Look for other community channels on Discord, Telegram, and other platforms to gauge the health of the community.
	
- **Popularity** 
	Consider the package's popularity, as indicated by GitHub stars and Pub.dev metrics (likes, Pub Points, and Popularity).

### 5. Test Before Implementation
 it's essential to test it first. Create a proof of concept or a test app to see if the package solves your problem as expected. This will help you avoid potential issues and ensure that the package is the right fit for your project. 

In conclusion, choosing the right package from Pub.dev's extensive library can be challenging. By following these steps and considering these metrics, you can make the right choice and find a package that meets your needs and helps you achieve your project goals.
